  - Fitness maintenance (running/MMA/calisthenics) — *ongoing routine, not a project*

## Long‑Term Goals & Ambitions
- **3–5 year vision:**
  - **Career:** Establish strong GenAI presence → stable/growing income; either scale GenAI impact in current firm or switch to more advanced GenAI work; build a viable **drone** professional track enabling partial non‑office work and travel.
  - **Family:** Prioritize daughter’s education & happy childhood (balance learning vs. play); guide toward future financial independence & meaningful work.
  - **Finance:** Reduce reliance on single income; strengthen additional streams (2 rental flats w/ mortgage, equities); build skills that generate portable income → optionality beyond office roles.
  - **Military:** Clarify end‑state (stay/exit); specialize in drones; consider path to (junior) officer track.
  - **Sports:** Maintain capable baseline — ≥20 km/week running at decent pace, 50+ push‑ups, 10 pull‑ups; continue amateur MMA.
- **10+ year ambition:**
  - Work optionality: no longer office-only; financially independent or minimally dependent on full-time employment; frequent travel (pleasure & mission-driven work).
  - Professional mastery: recognized expert with durable, portable skills.
  - Family outcomes: daughter becomes a strong, self-reliant young adult (mental & financial independence track).
  - Resilience: household prepared for adverse scenarios (war/crises) with plans and capabilities.
- **Non‑negotiables / values:** <>

## Military
- **Status & obligations:** Serves in Polish Territorial Defence (voluntary; 1‑month resignation notice). Full obligation in case of war/crisis (e.g., flood response).
- **Performance targets:** Spring annual physical — 3 km < 15:00; max push‑ups; max sit‑ups in 2 min. Progressing as drone operator; leading grassroots adoption of drone basics in unit.
- **Training cadence:**
  - **Physical:** 5–7 sessions/week total → 2–3 morning runs, 2–3 morning calisthenics, 2 evening MMA.
  - **Drone:** 2–3 hours/week on simulator (≤30 min per session) focused on FPV skills.
- **Upcoming deadlines/tests:** Spring — annual physical test (exact date TBD).

## Financials
- **Focus areas (next 12 months):**
  1) Monthly, deliberate small stock investments
  2) Monetize GenAI trainings/knowledge outside current employer
  3) Optimize mortgage costs on rental flats
- **Investment themes:** defense, drones, semiconductors, AI, undervalued value plays; diversify by geography (Poland/EU/USA)
- **Key upcoming decisions:** mortgage refinancing; phone contracts; car insurance; monthly stock allocation choices

## Sports & Health
- **Primary disciplines:** <e.g., MMA, running, calisthenics>
- **Weekly pattern:** <>
- **Constraints:** Morning windows for run/calisthenics; quiet/no‑noise calisthenics at home; 10:00–18:00 eating window; need muscle gain → balance running volume with protein/calorie intake to avoid muscle loss.
- **Near‑term targets (≤12 weeks):** None fixed — maintain weight/conditioning through winter. **Decision point:** define 2026 targets by 31‑12‑2025 (running/MMA/calisthenics + FPV sim hours).
